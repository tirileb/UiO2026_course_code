# Students survey

> This survey is designed to provide some information about your background and expectations about the course, such that I could adjust the course content, speed of delivery, assessment, and other parameters to better suit your needs.

> The data collected with this survey will be kept confidential and has no influence on your grade.

## 1. What is your name and preferred name if any?

Marius Paul Berger

## 2. What is your current title and affiliation/position? What year of the program are you in? Also add a link to your webpage if you have one.

PhD student, first year, https://www.sv.uio.no/econ/english/people/aca/marius15/

## 3. What is your primary field of research interests?

Political economy, behavioural economics

## 4. What interests you in structural estimation?

Have had no contact wiht structural estimation so far, yet it's a widely used approach. Also, I'm interested in how  narratives spread as well as application of network theory to economic/societal dynamics, which I thought would eventually "point" me to structural metrics as well? 

## 5. What is your previous econometrics training? Briefly list the models and methods you have studied, ideally indicating which ones you have had practical experience with, and using which software packages.

- 1st year masters "advanced econometrics"
- master's course on causal identification
- A short diff-in-diff PhD course (but focused mostly on application and intuition of common DiD issues)
- Adv. Applied Econometrics at UiO.
--> So overall ok understanding of theory, but still slow on connecting notation/equations to the intuition

Projects I worked on or was involved with where either smaller exercises from classes, spatial economics during my predoc, and rather unsophisticated applied reduced form estimates from my master's thesis.

## 6. What is your coding experience? List the programming languages that you have used in the past.

Mostly R, some Stata, beginner's experiments with Python.

## 7. What are your expectations of this course?

- Get a better idea of intuition and theory of structural metrics resp. "how to connect my intuition to the math"
- Have a reason to practice using github, python, and VSCode

## 8. Will you be taking exam to receive credit for this course?

Yes, very most likely
